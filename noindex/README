### Background Info ###
The robots.txt is not a good choice to blacklist your friendica 
installation from search indexes as this file is intended as a tool 
for webmasters to avoid server overload. Google does not *crawl* the 
pages listed in robots.txt but it does *index* those pages by using 
all the information (links, linktext) it finds on other pages. The 
better solution is to insert the noindex metatag to the header of all 
pages. This plugin does just that. If you enable this plugin, no page 
of your friendica site will be shown in the search engines.  



### Instructions ###
If this plugin is activated, robots.txt should not be present (or set 
to allow crawling), otherwise the search engines could not read the 
noindex tag an may continue to index your site by external 
information.
