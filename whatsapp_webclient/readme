Whatsapp WebClient integration,
needs the whatsapp webclient by Sascha Gehlich:
https://github.com/saschagehlich/node-whatsapp

1. install node.js 0.8.1.1
http://nodejs.org/
version 0.8.1.1 is needed, 0.6.19 will start, but cannot connect!

2. install node-whatsapp from
https://github.com/saschagehlich/node-whatsapp

3. aktivate addon
->
This will add an app which simply embeds
http(s)://YOUR-iIP:3888
into your friendica site.

[there won't be an integration as a 'connector'
(by me) ]

2. cron_check_webclient.sh 
is a cronjob script you might need, to verify your whatsapp webclient's running
-> adapt to your needs
